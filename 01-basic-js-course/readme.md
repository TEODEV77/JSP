# JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that has the ability to be used on many different devices. It can be used on personal computers, web servers, and smartphones. It is an interpreted language, object-oriented, weakly typed, and dynamic.

JavaScript was born with the need to generate dynamism on web pages and for users and companies to interact with each other. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and became an official standard of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1997.

## Why do we say that Javascript is a dynamic language?

It runs directly in the runtime stage, without a previous compilation stage. This allows us to test our code immediately; but it is also what makes errors not show up until the program is run

## Why is it weakly typed?

JavaScript is considered weakly typed because it does not strictly enforce data type consistency.
In other words, JavaScript allows operations on incompatible types, performing automatic type coercion as needed

## Is Javascript really an interpreted language?

JavaScript was purely an interpreted language. This means that the code was interpreted and executed line by line by a JavaScript engine, like V8 in Chrome and SpiderMonkey in Firefox, at runtime.

However, the modern JavaScript Engines like V8 use a combination of interpretation and a technique called "Just-In-Time" (JIT) compilation to optimize execution. In JIT, the JavaScript engine compiles the entire JavaScript code into bytecode just before execution, rather than interpreting it line by line. This improves performance, as the JavaScript can be compiled once and then executed multiple times.

## What does it mean that Javascript is Backwards Compatible

Backwards compatibility in JavaScript means that older scripts of JavaScript should run as expected in newer versions of the JavaScript engine. For instance, a script written in ES5 syntax should run correctly in an ES6 environment.

## Primitive and Object

In JavaScript, there are two types of data types: primitive and object.

# Variables types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| String | Contains sequences of characters, such as text |
| Number | Stores numeric values, either integers or decimals |
| Boolean | Stores **true** or **false** values |
| Null | Indicates that a variable has no value or is empty |
| Undefined | When a variable has been declared but not assigned a value |
| Array | Stores an ordered list of items |
| Object | Data structure that can contain properties and methods |
| Function | A reusable block of code that can be called. |
| Symbol | Unique identifier used for object properties |
| BigInt | To handle large integers |
